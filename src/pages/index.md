          In a [2019 IT Skills and Salary
          report](https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/content/salary-report/it-skills-and-salary-report/)
          published by Global Knowledge, 52% of IT decision-makers are in need
          of technologically-skilled personnel to meet their organizational
          goals and close the skills gap. 93% of those decision-makers agree
          that certified employees provide added value above and beyond the cost
          of certification.


          Another recent survey conducted in Q1 2020 by Gallup, an independent
          third-party company, shows how Associate and Professional Google Cloud
          certifications have enabled and boosted the required skills for
          different job roles within the cloud industry.
