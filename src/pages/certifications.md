    content: >-
      In a [2019 IT Skills and Salary
      report](https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/content/salary-report/it-skills-and-salary-report/)
      published by Global Knowledge, 52% of IT decision-makers are in need of
      technologically-skilled personnel to meet their organizational goals and
      close the skills gap. 93% of those decision-makers agree that certified
      employees provide added value above and beyond the cost of certification.


      Another recent survey conducted in Q1 2020 by Gallup, an independent
      third-party company, shows how Associate and Professional Google Cloud
      certifications have enabled and boosted the required skills for different
      job roles within the cloud industry.
